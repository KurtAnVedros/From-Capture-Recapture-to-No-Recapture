Since the datasets of EM signals is to large for github repositories, the Datasets was moved and is downloadable from a public shared OneDrive folder: https://1drv.ms/f/c/86d32251763ade23/EmohQPAAm6ZFtulBL5jUmAgBi8ueWJ7cbZ5OAVxVHhArZw?e=wfdN7Z 

The dataset should be extracted inside the Datasets folder for reproducability.
  Additionally, the modules will have to be extracted inside the appropriate results folders of "2_1_Train_1DCNNGANs_Model" and "2_2_Train_ResGANsModel" to reproduce the generated signals that was saved inside the Datasets/Signals/Numpy/Generated folder.
